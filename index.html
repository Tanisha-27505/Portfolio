							<h1>Tanisha Nazare</h1>
							<p> Watching a YouTube video titled ‘Why Data science is the future’ by Sundar Pichai gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in February 2017. 
								He states that better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in DS. Working with data - whether it is data mining, 
								data analysis or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms or data storage has always made me feel exhilarating. 
								My immediate goal after graduation is to become a Data Scientist. 
								In the long run I envision myself becoming a Data Scientist as I am hugely inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, 
								first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. His markers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS.
								Apart from academics, I have been a part of many activities during my under graduation. Having participated in college activities and having managed various events has not only improved my decision making but has also made me composed and tolerant. 
								I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Data Analytics domain. Experienced in data extraction, data analysis and developing final predictive model. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, technical writer and have excellent communication skills. 
								I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.

									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<p>Internships give the first hand exposure working in the real world. It allows us to implement skill, knowlegde and
										 the theoretical practice learnt before. I beleive that it is a learning curve with little experience of the professional world.
										  I have completed two internships through the recent years in my life.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world.
								It is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her.
								I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.

									<h2>Skills & Organizations</h2>
									<p>Skills are a important aspect of a person's career as they define your ability in your domain. In my opinion, with skills and 
										knowledge, socializing is also and important aspect. Throughout my academic career, I have joined a lot of clubs and organizations 
										for improving my self confidence, public speaking and networking. Technical as well as Non- technical knowledge are important when 
										it comes to thriving in the society. Here are a few of my skills and the organizations that I have joined uptil now.
